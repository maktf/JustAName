func TestDoIterativeFindNode (t *testing.T) {
	Initial all network like a linked list:
	[0] <- [1] <- [2] <- [3] <- [4] <- ... <- [number - 1]

	For each node to DoIterativeFindNode each node (including itself)

	According to definition, if length of returned node list is equal to 
	constant k, then check whether each node in shortlist is active or 
	inactive by calling time; else if length of returned node list is 
	less than constant k, then check whether any caliing returned node' distance 
	of each node in shortlist to source node is greater than or equal to this
	shortlist' shortest distantce.

	if passing the above possible conditions, this design matchs requirement
}

	DoStore function paif of (key, value) in each node in the above network

	DoIterativeStore function to UPDATE paif of (key, updated_value) in each 
	node in the above network

	Compare each node by LocalFindValue function with the above DoIterativeStore 
	function returned nodes to check

	If their NodeId is the same, this design matchs requirement
